# Detailed Descriptions - Stardew Valley Mod

### About the Mod

**Detailed Descriptions** is a mod created to provide more informative and detailed descriptions for seeds and crops in Stardew Valley. The goal is to help players make more informed decisions about which crops to plant by presenting information such as profitability, growing seasons, and details about replanting or crop regeneration. This way, the player can maximize farm efficiency and have a better understanding of the costs and benefits of each seed.

### Features

- **Detailed Information**: Each seed will receive a detailed description that includes:
  - The seasons in which it can be planted.
  - The number of days it takes to reach the initial harvest.
  - Whether it requires replanting or regenerates after harvest.
  - Purchase price of the seeds and selling price of the crops.
  - Estimated number of harvests during the full season cycle, including consecutive cycles (e.g., 56 days if the seed can be planted in two consecutive seasons).
  - Profitability calculated per cycle, taking into account costs and the amount of work required.
- **Automatic Translations**: Season information and other data are automatically translated, leveraging SMAPI's translation system.

### How It Works

This mod uses SMAPI events to intercept the relevant data files from Stardew Valley, such as `Data/Crops`, `Data/Objects`, and `Strings/Objects`. It then automatically calculates various statistics about each crop, including:

- How many days the plant takes to grow.
- How many times the crop can be harvested during a season.
- The profit per cycle considering the seed cost and the selling price.

The resulting description is generated dynamically, providing a clear view of the crop's profitability and characteristics.
